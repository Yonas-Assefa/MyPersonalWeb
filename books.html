                        I absolutely love to read and sometimes 
                        start to read whatever’s lying around without 
                        even realising it. Mind you, I’ve discovered some 
                        amazing books and learned some amazing stuff this way.
                         For instance, it’s how I discovered In Search of Excellence,
                          one of the best books I’ve ever read.
                        I don’t borrow books from other people or from the library, 
                        for two reasons. Firstly, if I like a book and find it useful 
                        I like to have a copy to hand for reference and re-reading. 
                        Secondly because I’m a massive underliner and annotator.
                         I love to underline key take away messages and add my own
                          notes, anecdotes and aide memoirs to books. For this reason 
                          I also don’t like to lend my personal copies to other people,
                           since they’re so precious and personal to me. If I think someone 
                           would benefit from reading a particular book I prefer to buy them 
                           their own copy.Here I will, over time, compile a list of the books
                            that I have found useful and that have made an impression on me.
                             I will give a review of each including the key lessons learned.Most 
                             of my books are non-fiction. But there are one or two fiction books
                              on my bookshelf too. <P><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25877188">Fikir Eskemekaber</a> |
